PyScreenstuck
=============

Introduction
------------
PyScreenstuck is a Python GUI application that checks if there is a new update on the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie. Is is very similar to my other project Screenstuck except for one minor difference: Instead of an image showing up on your desktop screen, a text message is sent to your phone via Google Voice.
