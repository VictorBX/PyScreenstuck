PyScreenstuck
===========

Introduction
------------
PyScreenstuck is a Python script that checks if there is a new update on the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie. Is is very similar to my other project Screenstuck except for one minor difference: Instead of an image showing up on your desktop screen, a text message is sent to your phone via Google Voice. 

Requires
--------
- Google Voice Account
- pygooglevoice

Progress
--------
- Checks every minute for an update

Todo
----
- Finish implementing pygooglevoice
- Send text msg
- User input on time delay between checking for updates
